1. One frustration is setting up ssh-agent to manage the git access to
bitbucket and github. I've added 90 day times to the ssh-add
commands. We'll see what happens. It seems that a reboot kills the
ssh-agent and so a new agent and key additions are required.

2. Terminal confusion with XTerm config, settings, colors, ..., yikes!
I need to start off with a very simple .Xresources or .Xdefaults file
and build it up. But, wow! Just wow! Tinkering R me.

3. the date is never updated; and ntpd is running. i don't get it. grrrr.

4. need to know how .login, .profile, and .bashrc are called. this
seems to be an ongoing confusion for me with Unix.
