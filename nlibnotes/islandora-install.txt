1. Islandora 11.2 install on a VM running Ubuntu 10-LTS.

2. First need to install the components Drupal and Fedora.

3. Drupal install
3.1. Used apt-get install drupal6. Drupal6 installed in /usr/share/drupal6.

3.2. Islandora instructions say to copy contents of drupal install
directory to /var/www/html. Why? Is this directory already specified
as the Apache2 document root? And if so, where? Is this directory
expected to be the document root for other Islandora configurations
and dependencies?

Where is the document root specified? Need to look in the default
Apache2 configuration files. For default Ubuntu install these are in
/etc/apache2 directory.

3.3. /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
  DocumentRoot /var/www

 - need to look at some other systems and then review Drupal install
   docs

3.4. Drupal documentation suggests moving drupal-x.x /var/www
 - therefore a soft link to /usr/share/drupal6 should work.

1. Drupal install completed by working through the Quick Install for
Developers.

  - I did need to reset the password for the drupal6 user
in MySQL and update the dbconfig file.
  - install did not work until I used the following URL:
    http://localhost/drupal/install.php
    [ not sure why that was the case ]

    [ still uncertain about the permissions for sites/default/ and
    settings.php. Drupal documentation could be more specific. ]

2. Islandora suggests "Proceed with initial configuration steps on the
Drupal "Welcome" page. But I am not certain what is required for
Islandora. Ditto for Module List. Perhaps none of these are required
for an Islandora setup. That is how I am going to proceed.

3. Next step: Install Fedora
3.1. Pre-install software checklist
   - Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 6
     [ How do I know such a kit is or is not installed? ]
     [ $ java -version # shows the version of any installed JRE ]

     [ apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
       dpkg-query -l *jdk* # shows what is available
       after install javac -version # shows java version ]

3.1.a. removed OpenJDK and installed Sun JDK 1.6 into /usr/local/jdk1.6

3.1.b. (20111120 update): Ubuntu 10.04
To make Sun's Java 6 JDK available on Ubuntu 10.04 add the new repository like so:

add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"
aptitude update
aptitude install sun-java6-jdk
update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun

From http://christiansons.net/mike/blog/2010/07/sun-java-6-on-ubuntu-10-04-10-10-and-later/


3.2. Download Fedora Repo SW
3.2.1. Fedora prerequisites cont'd.

 - download and install maven

 [ this is yet another dependency that seems to require its own
 special bin directory and addition to the PATH. I'm thinking I want
 one Apache Project tree, maybe /usr/share/ap or /usr/local/ap?  That
 won't work; there are too many files. I opt for /usr/local/maven ]

3.2.2. Creating fedora3 database and granting privileges to
 fedoraAdmin Yikes! The syntax of the GRANT statements in the
 documentation did not work for me. It took me a good 15 minutes of
 checking MySQL documentation and fiddling with quotation marks to get
 it right. The correct GRANT statement looks like this:

GRANT ALL ON fedora3.* TO 'fedoraAdmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';

 The statement in the Fedora documentation looks like this:

GRANT ALL ON fedora3.\* TO fedoraAdmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';

Note 2 errors: (1) ".\*" not recognized by MySQL; ".*" is. (2) missing
quotation marks around '<username>'@'localhost'.

3.3.3. first run of Fedora Commons install result:

band@aperol:~/Downloads$ sudo java jar fcrepo-installer-3.5.jar 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jar
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: jar

band@aperol:~/Downloads$ 

3.3.4. Java stack trace error result of not having ENV variables
available (I think). Remedied with a Restart, but Logout would have
been sufficient.

 - Fedora Admin pw: fedupadmin

2011-11-16

3.3.5. Fedora "quick" install succeeded after reboot and login (to set
up all the requisite ENV variables [ need a better way to do this ]).

3.3.6. However, it appears that CATALINA_HOME needs to be set to
support the Tomcat installation. Current documentation does not give
*any* suggestion about what it should be set to. Earlier Fedora 3.4
documentation does specify that CATALINA_HOME be set to
$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat *if* the "quick" install option is selected.
[ Why was this information not carried forward? ]

4. Fedora seems to be running. At least I was able to start
FedoraAdmin and create a new Object.

4.1. added rtf file as a datastream to new object, but some
understanding of the underlying data and object models is required.

4.2. Looking at the Islandora documentation I see that I should have
chosen "custom", not "quick" install. So now we get to see how to
uninstall Fedora and start that step over again.

4.2.1. Uninstall just looks like delete $FEDORA_HOME and delete MySQL
table and user?

4.3. Fedora "custom" install: following Islandora doc'n here:

https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA/Installing+Fedora

4.3.1. It looks like there is no content in the existing fedora3 DB
table, so I will leave it as it is and see what happens.

 [ log out and log in to reset everything ]

4.3.2. "custom" install went well; needed to provide mysql root
privileges to complete.

 - Islandora documentation says that custom install enables resource
   index by default, but that is not true in Fedora3.5. You must
   enable it when asked by the installer.

 - Did NOT use the install.properties script

4.3.3. ran $FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
 - catalina.out  had the following error:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: \-Xmx1024m
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: \-Xmx1024m
       at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)
       at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)
       at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190)
       at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
       at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301)
       at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)
Could not find the main class: \-Xmx1024m.  Program will exit.

 - however localhost:8080/fedora displayed a working page. So I don't
   understand what is not running.

 - I think the JAVA_OPTS env setup is wrong

4.3.4. 30+ minutes of fiddling to get fedora/tomcat/bin/startup.sh to
run without errors in catalina.out.
 - several updates /etc/alternatives/java to link to sun-jdk
 - purge and removal of remaining openjdk jres
 - comment out JAVA_OPTS env variable; syntax seems wrong

 - but it appears that Fedora is running.

 - suggestion to try fedora/admin doesn't work; error message:

Alternate HTML content should be placed here. This content requires the Adobe Flash Player. Get Flash

 - TIME FOR A BREAK.

2011-11-18

4.4. Continuing with the Islandora Fedora instructions.

4.4.1. Need to install Flash to use the fedora/admin webpage (depends
on Adobe Flex)
 - used Package Manager

4.4.2. OK, I have used the fedora/admin webpage to create a new object
with a new PID. I attempted to add an RTF datastream, but it looks
like XML is what is wanted.
 [ Definitely need to look at the Tutorials ]

4.4.3. fedora/admin webpage uses flash and popups that can get hidden.
 [ I do not think I can go further without having FOXML examples. ]

4.4.4. using the command-line shell script yields better window mgt
properties on a small laptop screen.

5. Setup Islandora demo on VirtualBox.
 - Adjustments: added xterm to support ssh xterm access

 - Observations:
   - Islandora installs Drupal in /var/www/drupal *not* /var/www/html
   - Islandora demo install needs Drupal update; drush is installed

5.1. (continuation of 4.4.4.)

5.1.1 Islandora "Pre-installation software checklist" step 3 states
that Islandora req'ts include PHP5-curl, PHP5-soap,
PHP5-xsl. PHP5-soap is not available as an aptitude package, but
php-soap is. I am assuming that "php-soap" will suffice.

5.1.2. Fedora GSearch install

2011-11-28

5.1.2. Fedora GSearch seems to be installed. That is, fedoragsearch.war
installed in tomcat/webapps and it did get unpacked. But need to
verify. Following the documentation steps for "See a demo at your own
site, almost out of the box"

[ SIDEBAR: moved this notes file to github/band/p5notes/nlibnotes ]

5.1.3. Following instructions in http://localhost:8080/fedoragsearch/#owndemo

fedora.fcfg customization - turn on messaging
 - doc'n does not say this, but fedora.fcfg is found in
   $FEDORA_HOME/server/config

fedora-users.xml customization - add GSearch admin
 - this file is also found in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config

Create the set of config files:
 - http://localhost:8080/fedoragsearch/basicproperties
   yields HTTP Status 404

 - key phrase is "... All you need to do is edit a few of the property
   values in the file fgsconfig-basic.properties, including passwords
   ...."

   - doc'n problem: the file fgsconfig-basic.properties is found in
   $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/fedoragsearch/FgsConfig/

 - fgsconfig-basic.properties file problems:
  (1) variable local.FEDORA_HOME=/Users/gertschmeltzpederson/f35

   [ Huh? Why is this local variable defined? And why is it defined
   for gert pederson's setup? ]
   [ my understanding: (1) redefine local.FEDORA_HOME;
   (2) insure fedoraAdmin password is correct (from install). ]

  (2) OK, I think I have udpated the fgsconfig-basic.properties
  file. But the next problem is "ant"; I don't think it is
  installed. Did I miss this in the preconditions?

  "ant" issues: using "apt-get install ant" has now reinstalled the
  OpenJDK JRE headless and lib packages. #$%&! OpenJDK is not
  recommended, however, installing Apache tools brings them in. This
  is frustrating and time consuming effort. [ I will try to uninstall
  the OpenJDK parts and see if ant remains installed. ]

 - $ apt-get purge openjdk-6-jre-headless
   removes ant; need to install ant separately from Apache.

 [ Maybe I need to install the Ubuntu versions of sun-jdk? I decide no
 for now. ]

 - ant installed using instructions from here:
   http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html

 - setting the configuration files req'd sudo having access to all the
   appropriate env variables. But it was successful, or reported being
   so.

 - Tomcat restarted

   However: The documentation page visible at the local site has links to
   * The Update Index Page
     ...

   that contains the following URL:

   http://miranth.cvt.dk/fedoragsearch/rest?operation=updateIndex

  - Was this link supposed to be updated? Frustration
    continues. Replacing "miranth.cvt.dk" with "localhost:8080 yields
    an empty web page.

BREAK TIME
