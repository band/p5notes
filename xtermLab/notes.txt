1. using app-defaults/XTerm-color in .Xdefaults.
  - still confused about what controls what; e.g.,
    - when XTerm is started, which dot files are evaluated (if any)
    - when OpenBSD Xwindows is started, then what dot files are
      evaluated on wmanager startup and what files are evaluated on
      XTerm startup?

2. using colorls in place of ls, but wonder how the colors can be reassigned.
   - also what is with the color nonesense in Emacs?
