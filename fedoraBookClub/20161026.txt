Questions:

This is a temporary document for collecting questions and topics to be
shared with Drs. Jim Hendler and Dean Allemang to help inform his book
club introduction teleconference on, “Semantic Web for the Working
Ontologist”.


1. What do we do when asserting an external URI, and it stops
resolving? We’re left with a URI representing a thing, but no
available metadata about that thing.

DA: diff between URI and URL. URI is an identifier that can be shared.
JH: importance of URI design (linked data relies on good URIs)
    tension between LD world & shortened links (need persistence)

2. When we assert a URI, are we expected to trust any changes to the
external metadata? Does the point in time a statement was asserted
matter?

DA: making new statements about something on the web is a general
problem for the web. FIBO does not use Wikipedia for definitions
because persistence is needed. Pages have a contract on their
durability?
JH: RDF; named graph; how to make assertions about assertions
(reification). newer SPARQL allows named graphs. adding graph names to
a triple store. can make local assertions about external
resources. can keep local metadata about external web items.

Q: who names the graph and makes verions of it?
DA: can go either way; can have a service contract with resource
providers.

3. When there isn’t an existing predicate or resource for something
we’d like to describe, what’s the best practice for minting a new URI?
Is there any software you’d recommend to make it easier?

DA: FIBO work. Enterprise data council, stds work, slower
moving. chose minting human-readable URIs. FAO agravoc (numeric URIs,
change labels).
JH: 2 audiences: machine and human. depends on the goals. can put
alternate names and comments in RDF.
DA: use a notation for persistent identity in the RDF.
JH: can use "see also" in RDF. provide a formal name and a set of
synonyms.

4. Does a URI have to resolve via HTTP/DNS? How about via a link
resolver?
DA: same as Q#1.
JH: key is persistence.

5. When we want to make statements about external URIs, what’s the
best practice to make them available? Publish them as parts of related
graphs, mint a local URI with owl:sameAs and use that instead, or
something else?

DA: (jh and i will disagree) inside the bank; just re-use the IRIs for
country and currency ISO codes; mint local URIs and use owl:sameAs to
connect them. bank needs to vet outside resources and cache vetted
copies. normative vs. informative.
JH: Brits spent time on design of URIs. try to keep local local.

6. When is the time not to mint a local URI for an external entity?
In a distributed web environment, is it necessary for a web
application to distinguish an internal entity and an external entity?

DA: similar to Q#5. industry context different from general web
context.

7. when we want to ingest metadata about external URIs, for caching or
indexing purpose, what’s the best practice for tracking the
provenance?  keep them in a separate graph?

JH: stds for provenance (PROV, PROVO) are becoming important. need to
keep source info from the start.
DA: noSQL doc stores with RDF supports self-mgt of docs.

8. The library/archive/museum community is increasingly exposing its
resources and collections via linked RDF. What are the existing and
emergent practices for querying and inferencing across institutional
boundaries?
JH: current, important issue. creation of small lightweight
stds. schema.org.

9. How to achieve the vision of semantic web as “an organized
worldwide system where information flows from one place to another in
a smooth but orderly way” if there is no gatekeeper for the data on
the web (“data wilderness”).  How does the human or the machine know
what data to trust/to use/to update? Is there a limit to AAA principle
(anyone can say anything about any topic)?


10. What are best practices around storing linked data for internal /
application use? What are good reasons for storing and using triples
as such? When would it make more sense to store the data in some other
(presumably more efficient) format, with the ability to output triples
as needed for publication?

11. what are the challenges of semantic modeling?  What is your advice
to meet those challenges?




Modeling?

da: existing data landscape is varied
professional data modelers; data warehousing models
look at existing models and spreadsheets
what distinctions are missing or needed?
URI questions are crucial
relational data modelers are good for a start

jh: ontology is being used to talk about the model
    (not so much as the formal)

==============================
Dean and Jim announcement:
3rd Edition: add more linked-data landscape to the book

What should be included in the new book?

Andrew Wood: book club follow-up
